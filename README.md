Gowut (Go Web UI Toolkit) is a full-featured, easy to use, platform independent Web UI Toolkit written in pure Go, no platform dependent native code is linked or called.

For documentation please visit the [**Gowut Wiki**](https://github.com/icza/gowut/wiki).

Development takes place in the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/icza/gowut/tree/dev).

## Quick install ##

To quickly install (or update to) the **latest** version, type:

    go get -u github.com/icza/gowut/...

## Quick test ##

To quickly test it and see it in action, run the following example applications.

Let's assume you're in the root of the Gowut project:

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/icza/gowut

**1. Showcase of Features.**

This one auto-opens itself in your default browser.

    go run _examples/showcase/showcase.go

The Showcase of Features is also available live: https://gowut-demo.herokuapp.com/show

**2. A single window example.**

This one auto-opens itself in your default browser.

    go run _examples/simple/simple_demo.go

And this is how it looks:

**3. Login window example with session management.**

Change directory so that the demo can read the test cert and key files:

    cd _examples/login
    go run login_demo.go

Open the page `https://localhost:3434/guitest/` in your browser to see it.
